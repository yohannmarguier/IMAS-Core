// UDA smoke round trip (issue #23, feasibility spike / tracer bullet for #21).
//
// Proves the whole UDA characterization machine end-to-end before any
// behavioral breadth is attempted (the PRD's subtask-1 gate): one equilibrium
// scalar, seeded through the plain HDF5 backend, reads back byte-identical
// through the UDA backend in *remote mode* -- i.e. across the wire, through a
// real UDA server running the `IMAS` server plugin (linked against a server-side
// IMAS-Core), addressed by the public C ABI. This is the UDA analogue of
// test_mdsplus.cpp's tracer bullet, but read-only: UDA has no remote write path
// (PRD Solution), so parity arrives via a seed-then-reopen fixture rather than a
// write->read round trip. Seeding via HDF5 is fixture setup -- it plays the role
// the baked model tree plays for MDSplus; the subject under test is always the
// IMAS-Core UDA client.
//
// The whole reference stack (server + `IMAS` plugin + IMAS-Core + IDSDef.xml
// 4.1.1) runs in one container; docker/uda/run.sh builds it and drives this
// suite. See docker/uda/README.md.
//
// Build-gated by AL_CONTRACT_HAVE_UDA (defined in CMakeLists.txt only when a UDA
// backend is built -- AL_BACKEND_UDA or AL_BACKEND_UDAFAT) so the file compiles
// out entirely otherwise; runtime-skipped (GTEST_SKIP()) when UDA_HOST is unset,
// per TEST_STRATEGY D4 -- absent/skipped, never failed.
//
// Remoteness assumption: run.sh does not set IMAS_LOCAL_HOSTS, so the
// imas://localhost/uda authority is NOT short-circuited to a local backend by
// checkUriHost (src/al_context.cpp) -- the read genuinely traverses the wire to
// uda_server. Do not set IMAS_LOCAL_HOSTS in the reference container.

// Broadens the tracer bullet above from one scalar to the full equilibrium-seed
// composite shape (scalar + timebase-carrying 2-D array + constraints AOS,
// tests/contract/equilibrium_seed.h — issue #4/D5), reusing the seed's own
// generator and FNV-1a hash oracle unchanged: seed via HDF5 (fixture setup,
// same role the baked model tree plays for MDSplus), reopen the identical path
// through the UDA backend in remote mode, recompute the hash over what UDA
// reads back, and assert it matches the seed's own expected_hash().
//
// Empirically (against the docker/uda/ reference stack): the composite shape
// is a **divergence**, not a defect -- the same wall MDSplus hits against its
// baked model tree (TRACEABILITY.md Part 4's EquilibriumSeedMatrix/Mdsplus
// row). The scalar sub-shape alone is real DD (`vacuum_toroidal_field/r0`,
// already proven read-only-parity by UdaSmokeRoundTrip above), but the
// generator's flat `profiles_1d/psi` leaf and generic `constraints` AOS have
// no counterpart in equilibrium's real DD-4.1.1 layout (`profiles_1d` is
// itself a struct_array, not a plain field): UDA's remote get() resolves
// every path against the DD schema it loads at startup (src/uda/uda_xml.cpp),
// so `al_plugin_read_data` fails immediately on `profiles_1d/psi` with
// "cannot find node equilibrium/profiles_1d/psi in data dictionary
// (profiles_1d not found)". There is nothing to fix -- the fixture's
// synthetic composite shape simply cannot transfer to a DD-schema-validating
// backend. Unlike EquilibriumSeedMatrix's per-backend GTEST_SKIP() (that
// fixture's body genuinely runs for its other, non-MDSplus parameters), this
// suite has no other instance to keep the seed/read machinery exercised, so
// the test runs the real seed-then-reopen attempt every time, asserts the
// *specific* known failure signature, and only then GTEST_SKIP()s -- if the
// divergence ever disappears (e.g. the UDA backend gains partial-path
// resolution), the assertion below fails loudly instead of this test quietly
// staying "skipped" over a silently-changed reality.
